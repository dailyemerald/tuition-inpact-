            Seven in every 10 college graduates had loan debt in 2013, the Institute for College Access & Success reports. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Their average cost: $28,400. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2014, half of UO’s graduating class had debt of their own. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Their average cost: $24,508. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Next year, tuition and fees will rise about 3.7 percent for UO students — up to $32,023.50 for out of state students and $10,288.50 for Oregon residents. 
            <br>
            <br>
            About a quarter of UO’s students are designated as “high need” students because they’re eligible for a Federal Pell grant — this typically means their parents make under $50,000 per year. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But the most they can receive in aid next year is $5,775 — which leaves a significant cost to be repaid. 
            <br>

            Not all students struggle. But for those who do, the work load can be enormous.

            “Usually the conversation is, ‘this is my dream school, I've worked hard to get here, how do I stay here?’" Brooks said. “Those are difficult conversations.”

            Here are stories of three undergraduates living every day with the realities of paying for their own educations - and what that cost has come to mean for them.

                from $2,485 in 1990 to $6,928 in 2012 and continues to rise, according to data from the Pew Research Center. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Here at the University of Oregon, half of the 2014 undergraduate class had borrowed student loans. Those who had left with an average loan debt of $24,508. 
                <br>
                <br>
                According to Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships Jim Brooks, the University of Oregon has limited funds to disburse financial aid to students as a state institution. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In dollars, the Department of Financial Aid and Scholarships disburses about $235 million dollars a year in aid for students. About $178 million of that is aid that comes from the federal government. 
                <br>
                <br>
                High-need students can receive the Federal Pell Grant - a federal allocation disbursed to students who usually have parental incomes of less than $50,000 - in addition to loans.
                <br>
                <br>
                About 25 percent of all undergraduate students received the Federal Pell Grant during the 2013-2014 school year. This works out to around 37 percent of resident undergraduates and eight percent of nonresident undergraduates – about 5,400 students each year.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the 2015-2016 school year the maximum a student can receive on the Pell Grant is $5,775. And with in-state tuition estimated at $10,288.50 and out of state tuition at $34,039.50 for the same year (not including the cost of books or living expenses), many students - even the pell eligible ones - are still strapped for cash and forced into loans. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The University of Oregon hopes to raise money for financial aid through the current 
                capital campaign in order to “put a dent in the cost for students.” Recently, Connie Balmer, a member of the UO Board of Trustees, and her husband Steve Ballmer, a former CEO of Microsoft, donated $25 million to help fund Pathway Oregon, a scholarship program that covers education costs for pell-eligible Oregon natives.

                $2billion capital campaign 
                $25 million for Pathway Oregon
                <br>
                <br>
                As of Fall 2013, there were 1,629 students in the pathway Oregon program. That’s 12.5 percent of the in-state students enrolled that fall. For many of the other 11,500 in-state students and 11,419 out-of-state students, paying for school required a bit more.
                <br>
                <br>
                And the cost keeps climbing.
                <br>
                <br>
                For Brooks, working with high-need students, especially high-need nonresident students for whom the costs of attending UO are significantly higher, involves hard conversations about the realities of funding their education.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Usually the conversation is, ‘this is my dream school, I've worked hard to get here, how do I stay here?’" Brooks said. “Those are difficult conversations.”
